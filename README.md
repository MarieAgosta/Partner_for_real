#Retrieving Data 

Downloaded the UKLungDeaths data from R and looked at it to get a better idea of the data available

It is composed of three time-series objects: both sexes (ldeaths), males (mdeaths) and females (fdeaths). It shows monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma in the UK, 1974–1979. 

Basic Transformations on the Data 

I then proceeded to perform basic descriptive stats to get a better idea of the trends of the available data, I plotted each time-series and then plotted male and female together to see the correlation. 

The range showed the disparity in range from male to female deaths and the summary stats reinforced this. 
Male numbers are all together higher.  Both groups are strongly correlated, which is expected given what they are measuring and the time frame.

The male deaths being so much higher than female deaths could be due to environmental and occupational factors but it also could be due to cultural norms of the 1970’s as well. More research is needed to draw any causal conclusions.
