data(UKLungDeaths)

#looking at UKLungDeaths data on the tab that layouts the data in R

?UKLungDeaths

#The data is broken down into three different time-series objects: 
# both sexes (ldeaths), males (mdeaths) and females (fdeaths).
# It shows monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in the UK, 1974â€“1979

plot(ldeaths)
plot(fdeaths)
plot(mdeaths)

# I'm plotting male and female deaths (below) to see if there is a trend or if there 
# are large disparities 

plot(mdeaths, fdeaths)

# The overall trend is the same
# I'll look at range first for female and male deaths 

range(mdeaths)

#[1]  940 2750
# Much larger range for males, compared to females.

range(fdeaths)

#[1]  330 1141

# Looking at overall summary statistics to see if male numbers are larger
# across the board 

summary(mdeaths)

#Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#940    1138    1344    1496    1846    2750 

summary(fdeaths)

#Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#330.0   411.0   512.0   560.7   681.5  1141.0 

# There is an equal amount of data for both men and women, therefore the higher numbers in 
# for men speak to potential enviromental factors (working in mines) and potential cultural
# factors (perhaps men smoked more cigerettes than women..?) These are merely guesstimates
# as to some of the trends. 

sd (mdeaths)
